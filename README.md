# Android_Cafe_Application
Final year university project using Android (Java) and the Google Firebase suite of backend products. This is a Smart Campus apps, in particular one that was suggested regarding ordering at cafe/food outlet. 

It is an app where a user comes to the cafe, picks a table, scans a QR code which would identify the table and potentially the location. This allows access to the menu for the location, where the user can then create an order from the menu. Once an order is completed, it is sent to a database and staff are notified that a new order has been placed. Staff can then prepare this order and bring it to the table. 

This is a proof of concept and only the frontend and minimal backend are provided. No payment options are available
